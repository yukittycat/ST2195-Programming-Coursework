# ST2195-Programming-Coursework

This coursework aims to use 2009 ASA Statistical Computing and Graphics Data Expo ([Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7)) consisting of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008, to answer the following questions:

1. When is the best time of day, day of week, and time of year to fly to minimise delays?
2. Do older planes suffer more delays?
3. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
4. Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
5. Use the available resources to construct a model that predicts delays.

R and Python are used to answer all questions. SQL is used to query the database created from DBI (R) library. 

The R_files and Python_files folders contain RMarkdown & Jupyter Notebook files, each answering the 5 questions, respectively.
